# EDA Datasets

This folder contains **sample Airbnb listings datasets** covering **12 months of data from 2024–2025** across New Zealand.  
The samples (≤25 MB each) are included here to illustrate the data structure while keeping the repository lightweight.  

These datasets were used for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover seasonal trends, price distributions, and location-based variations.  

## Mini Metadata
Each monthly file (`listings_<Month>_sample.csv`) contains a subset of Airbnb property listings with the following key attributes:

- **Listing ID** – unique identifier for each property  
- **Host Information** – host ID, response rate, number of listings  
- **Property Details** – room type, accommodates, bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities  
- **Location** – city, neighbourhood, latitude/longitude  
- **Pricing** – nightly rate, cleaning fee, minimum nights  
- **Availability** – calendar availability (30/60/90 days)  
- **Review Metrics** – number of reviews, review scores (cleanliness, accuracy, communication, value, etc.)  

## Full Datasets
Due to GitHub file size limits, the **complete raw datasets** are hosted externally.
